# ARM Microarchitecture Visualizer


ARM Microarchitecture Visualizer is a **Senior Design Project (SDP)** that provides an interactive and educational visualization of **ARM assembly instruction execution** at the **microarchitecture and pipeline level**.

The project aims to bridge the gap between low-level ARM assembly code and internal processor behavior, helping students better understand how instructions are executed inside a processor.

## Project Description

Modern computer architecture concepts such as instruction pipelines and microarchitectural stages are often difficult to grasp through theory alone.  
This project visualizes how ARM instructions propagate through core pipeline stages, making instruction execution transparent and intuitive.

The visualizer focuses on step-by-step execution and clear representation of internal states to support learning and teaching of computer architecture.

## Initial Work

The initial phase of the project focuses on planning, architecture definition, and repository setup.  
The following tasks have been completed or are currently in progress:

- Creation of a public GitHub repository with proper version control
- Definition of project scope and educational goals
- Identification of core ARM pipeline stages:
  - Instruction Fetch
  - Instruction Decode
  - Execute
  - Memory Access
  - Write-Back
- Planning the modular structure of the project
- Preparation for visualization and instruction flow modeling

---

## Objectives

- Visualize ARM assembly instruction flow through pipeline stages
- Show internal processor state changes during execution
- Support step-by-step instruction execution for educational purposes
- Provide clear and intuitive microarchitecture-level visualization
- Assist students in understanding ARM-based processor design
